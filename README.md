# AI.NeuralNetwork

A Neural Network is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodology that attempts to mimic the behavior of the neurons in our brains.  Neural networks really shine when it comes to pattern recognition and are used in image and character recognition programs, data filtering applications, and even robotics. A neural net was even used to drive an automated vehicle across the US after learning from observing human drivers.  In this repo, a basic framework for AI Neural Networks in C# and teach our program to perform basic X-OR operations.
